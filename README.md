# Object-Detection-Demonstration

This project uses a pretrained Yolov7 onnx file to detect where a zombie is in the game and it moves the cursor to that enemy. While it isn't the best aimbot out there, there are some improvements that could be made like switching to Yolov8, using a smaller version, make some improvements to how the mouse moves to the enemy possibly even making it move a physical mouse instead of relying on the win32 API.
